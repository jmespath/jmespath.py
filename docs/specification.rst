JMESPath Specification
======================

This document describes the specification for jmespath.
In the specification, examples are shown through the use
of a ``search`` function.  The syntax for this function is::

    search(<jmespath expr>, <JSON document>) -> <return value>

For simplicity, the jmespath expression and the JSON document are
not quoted.  For example::

    search(foo, {"foo": "bar"}) -> "bar"

In this specification, ``null`` is used as a return value whenever an
expression does not match.  ``null`` is the generic term that maps to the JSON
``null`` value.  Implementations can replace the ``null`` value with the
language equivalent value.


Grammar
=======

The grammar is specified using ABNF, as described in `RFC4234`_

::

    expression        = sub-expression / index-expression / or-expression / identifier / "*"
    expression        =/ multi-select-list / multi-select-hash / literal / function-expression
    sub-expression    = expression "." ( identifier /

Identifiers
===========


::

    identifier        = unquoted-string / quoted-string
    unquoted-string   = (%x41-5A / %x61-7A / %x5F) *(  ; a-zA-Z_
                            %x30-39  /  ; 0-9
                            %x41-5A /  ; A-Z
                            %x5F    /  ; _
                            %x61-7A)   ; a-z
    quoted-string     = quote 1*(unescaped-char / escaped-char) quote
    unescaped-char    = %x20-21 / %x23-5B / %x5D-10FFFF
    escape            = %x5C   ; Back slash: \
    quote             = %x22   ; Double quote: '"'
    escaped-char      = escape (
                            %x22 /          ; "    quotation mark  U+0022
                            %x5C /          ; \    reverse solidus U+005C
                            %x2F /          ; /    solidus         U+002F
                            %x62 /          ; b    backspace       U+0008
                            %x66 /          ; f    form feed       U+000C
                            %x6E /          ; n    line feed       U+000A
                            %x72 /          ; r    carriage return U+000D
                            %x74 /          ; t    tab             U+0009
                            %x75 4HEXDIG )  ; uXXXX                U+XXXX

An ``identifier`` is the most basic expression and can be used to extract a single
element from a JSON document.  The return value for an ``identifier`` is the
value associated with the identifier.  If the ``identifier`` does not exist in
the JSON document, than a ``null`` value is returned.

From the grammar rule listed above identifiers can be one of more characters,
and must start with ``A-Za-z_``.

An identifier can also be quoted.  This is necessary when an identifier has
characters not specified in the ``unquoted-string`` grammar rule.
In this situation, an identifier is specified with a double quote, followed by
any number of ``unescaped-char`` or ``escaped-char`` characters, followed by a
double quote.  The ``quoted-string`` rule is the same grammar rule as a JSON
string, so any valid string can be used between double quoted, include JSON
supported escape sequences, and six character unicode escape sequences.

Note that any identifier that does not start with ``A-Za-z_`` **must**
be quoted.


Examples
--------

::

   search(foo, {"foo": "value"}) -> "value"
   search(bar, {"foo": "value"}) -> null
   search(foo, {"foo": [0, 1, 2]}) -> [0, 1, 2]
   search("with space", {"with space": "value"}) -> "value"
   search("special chars: !@#", {"special chars: !@#": "value"}) -> "value"
   search("quote\"char", {"quote\"char": "value"}) -> "value"
   search("\u2713", {"\u2713": "value"}) -> "value"


SubExpressions
==============

::

    sub-expression    = expression "." ( identifier /
                                         multi-select-list /
                                         multi-select-hash /
                                         "*" )

A subexpression is a combination of two expressions separated by the '.' char.
A subexpression is evaluted as follows:

* Evaluate the expression on the left with the original JSON document.
* Evaluate the expression on the right with the result of the left expression
  evaluation.

In pseudocode::

  left-evaluation = search(left-expression, original-json-document)
  result = search(right-expression, left-evaluation)


A subexpression is itself an expression, so there can be multiple levels of
subexpressions: ``grandparent.parent.child``.


Examples
--------

Given a JSON document: ``{"foo": {"bar": "baz"}}``, and a jmespath expression:
``foo.bar``, the evaluation process would be::

  left-evaluation = search("foo", {"foo": {"bar": "baz"}}) -> {"bar": "baz"}
  result = search("bar": {"bar": "baz"}) -> "baz"

The final result in this example is ``"baz"``.

Additional examples::

   search(foo.bar, {"foo": {"bar": "value"}}) -> "value"
   search(foo.bar, {"foo": {"baz": "value"}}) -> null
   search(foo.bar.baz, {"foo": {"bar": {"baz": "value"}}}) -> "value"


Index Expressions
=================

::

  index-expression  = expression bracket-specifier / bracket-specifier
  bracket-specifier = "[" (number / "*") "]" / "[]"

An index expression is used to access elements in a list.  Indexing is 0 based,
the index of 0 refers to the first element of the list.  A negative number is a
valid index.  A negative number indicates that indexing is relative to the end
of the list, specifically::

  negative-index == (length of array) + negative-index

Given an array of length ``N``, an index of ``-1`` would be equal to a positive
index of ``N - 1``, which is the last element of the list.  If an index
expression refers to an index that is greater than the length of the array, a
value of ``null`` is returned.

For the grammar rule ``expression bracket-specifier`` the ``expression`` is
first evaluated, and then return value from the ``expression`` is given as
input to the ``bracket-specifier``.

Using a "*" character within a ``bracket-specifier`` is discussed below in the
``wildcard expressions`` section.

Flatten Operator
----------------

When the character sequence ``[]`` is provided as a bracket specifier, then
a flattening operation occurs on the current result.  The flattening operator
will merge sublists in the current result into a single list.  The flattening
operator has the following semantics:

* Create an empty result list.
* Iterate over the elements of the current result.
* If the current element is not a list, add to the end of the result list.
* If the current element is a list, add each element of the current element
  to the end of the result list.
* The result list is now the new current result.

Once the flattening operation has been performed, subsequent operations
are projected onto the flattened list with the same semantics as a
wildcard expression.  Thus the difference between ``[*]`` and ``[]`` is that
``[]`` will first flatten sublists in the current result.


Examples
--------

::

  search([0], ["first", "second", "third"]) -> "first"
  search([-1], ["first", "second", "third"]) -> "third"
  search([100], ["first", "second", "third"]) -> null
  search(foo[0], {"foo": ["first", "second", "third"]) -> "first"
  search(foo[100], {"foo": ["first", "second", "third"]) -> null
  search(foo[0][0], {"foo": [[0, 1], [1, 2]]}) -> 0


Or Expressions
==============

::

  or-expression     = expression "||" expression

An or expression will evaluate to either the left expression or the right
expression.  If the evaluation of the left expression is not false it is used as
the return value.  If the evaluation of the right expression is not false it is
used as the return value.  If neither the left or right expression are
non-null, then a value of null is returned.  A false value corresponds to any
of the following conditions::

* Empty list: ``[]``
* Empty object: ``{}``
* Empty string: ``""``
* False boolean: ``false``
* Null value: ``null``

A true value corresponds to any value that is not false.


Examples
--------

::

  search(foo || bar, {"foo": "foo-value"}) -> "foo-value"
  search(foo || bar, {"bar": "bar-value"}) -> "bar-value"
  search(foo || bar, {"foo": "foo-value", "bar": "bar-value"}) -> "foo-value"
  search(foo || bar, {"baz": "baz-value"}) -> null
  search(foo || bar || baz, {"baz": "baz-value"}) -> "baz-value"
  search(override || mylist[-1], {"mylist": ["one", "two"]}) -> "two"
  search(override || mylist[-1], {"mylist": ["one", "two"], "override": "yes"}) -> "yes"


MultiSelect List
================

::

    multi-select-list = "[" ( expression *( "," expression ) "]"

A multiselect expression is used to extract a subset of elements from a JSON
hash.  There are two version of multiselect, one in which the multiselect
expression is enclosed in ``{...}`` and one which is enclosed in ``[...]``.
This section describes the ``[...]`` version.  Within the start and closing
characters is one or more non expressions separated by a comma.  Each
expression will be evaluated against the JSON document.  Each returned element
will be the result of evaluating the expression. A ``multi-select-list`` with
``N`` expressions will result in a list of length ``N``.  Given a multiselect
expression ``[expr-1,expr-2,...,expr-n]``, the evaluated expression will return
``[evaluate(expr-1), evaluate(expr-2), ..., evaluate(expr-n)]``.

Examples
--------

::

  search([foo,bar], {"foo": "a", "bar": "b", "baz": "c"}) -> ["a", "b"]
  search([foo,bar[0]], {"foo": "a", "bar": ["b"], "baz": "c"}) -> ["a", "b"]
  search([foo,bar.baz], {"foo": "a", "bar": {"baz": "b"}}) -> ["a", "b"]
  search([foo,baz], {"foo": "a", "bar": "b"}) -> ["a", null]


MultiSelect Hash
================

::

    multi-select-hash = "{" ( keyval-expr *( "," keyval-expr ) "}"
    keyval-expr       = identifier ":" expression

A ``multi-select-hash`` expression is similar to a ``multi-select-list``
expression, except that a hash is created instead of a list.  A
``multi-select-hash`` expression also requires key names to be provided, as
specified in the ``keyval-expr`` rule.  Given the following rule::

    keyval-expr       = identifier ":" expression

The ``identifier`` is used as the key name and the result of evaluating the
``expression`` is the value associated with the ``identifier`` key.

Each ``keyval-expr`` within the ``multi-select-hash`` will correspond to a
single key value pair in the created hash.


Examples
--------

Given a ``multi-select-hash`` expression ``{foo: one.two, bar: bar}`` and the
data ``{"bar": "bar", {"one": {"two": "one-two"}}}``, the expression is
evaluated as follows:

1. A hash is created: ``{}``
2. A key ``foo`` is created whose value is the result of evaluating ``one.two``
   against the provided JSON document: ``{"foo": evaluate(one.two, <data>)}``
3. A key ``bar`` is created whose value is the result of evaluting the
   expression ``bar`` against the provided JSON document.

The final result will be: ``{"foo": "one-two", "bar": "bar"}``.

Additional examples:

::

  search({foo: foo, bar: bar}, {"foo": "a", "bar": "b", "baz": "c"})
                -> {"foo": "a", "bar": "b"}
  search({foo: foo, firstbar: bar[0]}, {"foo": "a", "bar": ["b"]})
                -> {"foo": "a", "firstbar": "b"}
  search({foo: foo, "bar.baz": bar.baz}, {"foo": "a", "bar": {"baz": "b"}})
                -> {"foo": "a", "bar.baz": "b"}
  search({foo: foo, baz: baz}, {"foo": "a", "bar": "b"})
                -> {"foo": "a", "bar": null}


Wildcard Expressions
====================

::

    expression        =/ "*"
    bracket-specifier = "[" "*" "]"

A wildcard expression is a expression of either ``*`` or ``[*]``.  A wildcard
expression can return multiple elements, and the remaining expressions are
evaluated against each returned element from a wildcard expression.  The
``[*]`` syntax applies to a list type and the ``*`` syntax applies to a hash
type.

The ``[*]`` syntax (referred to as a list wildcard expression) will return all
the elements in a list.  Any subsequent expressions will be evaluated against
each individual element.  Given an expression ``[*].child-expr``, and a list of
N elements, the evaluation of this expression would be ``[child-expr(el-0),
child-expr(el-2), ..., child-expr(el-N)]``.  This is referred to as a
**projection**, and the ``child-expr`` expression is projected onto the
elements of the resulting list.

Once a projection has been created, all subsequent expressions are projected
onto the resulting list.

The ``*`` syntax (referred to as a hash wildcard expression) will return a list
of the hash element's values.  Any subsequent expression will be evaluated
against each individual element in the list (this is also referred to as a
**projection**).

Note that if any subsequent expression after a wildcard expression returns a
``null`` value, it is omitted from the final result list.

A list wildcard expression is only valid for the JSON array type.  If a list
wildcard expression is applied to any other JSON type, a value of ``null`` is
returned.

Similarly, a hash wildcard expression is only valid for the JSON object type.
If a hash wildcard expression is applied to any other JSON type, a value of
``null`` is returned.

Examples
--------

::

  search([*].foo, [{"foo": 1}, {"foo": 2}, {"foo": 3}]) -> [1, 2, 3]
  search([*].foo, [{"foo": 1}, {"foo": 2}, {"bar": 3}]) -> [1, 2]
  search('*.foo', {"a": {"foo": 1}, "b": {"foo": 2}, "c": {"bar": 1}}) -> [1, 2]


Literal Expressions
===================

::

    literal           = "`" json-value "`"
    literal           =/ "`" 1*(unescaped-literal / escaped-literal) "`"
    unescaped-literal = %x20-21 /       ; space !
                            %x23-5A /   ; # - [
                            %x5D-5F /   ; ] ^ _
                            %x61-7A     ; a-z
                            %x7C-10FFFF ; |}~ ...
    escaped-literal   = escaped-char / (escape %x60)

A literal expression is an expression that allows arbitrary JSON objects to be
specified.  This is useful in filter expressions as well as multi select hashes
(to create arbitrary key value pairs), but is allowed anywhere an expression is
allowed.  The specification includes the ABNF for JSON, implementations should
use an existing JSON parser to parse literal values.  Note that the ``\```
character must now be escaped in a ``json-value`` which means implementations
need to handle this case before passing the resulting string to a JSON parser.

Note the second literal rule.  This is used to specify a string such that
double quotes do not have to be included.  This means that the literal
expression ``\`"foo"\``` is equivalent to ``\`foo\```.


Examples
--------

::

  search(`foo`, "anything") -> "foo"
  search(`"foo"`, "anything") -> "foo"
  search(`[1, 2]`, "anything") -> [1, 2]
  search(`true`, "anything") -> true
  search(`{"a": "b"}`.a, "anything") -> "b"
  search({first: a, type: `mytype`}, {"a": "b", "c": "d"}) -> {"first": "b", "type": "mytype"}


Filter Expressions
==================

::

  list-filter-expr  = expression comparator expression
  comparator        = "<" / "<=" / "==" / ">=" / ">" / "!="

A filter expression provides a way to select JSON elements based on a
comparison to another expression.  A filter expression is evaluated as follows:
for each element in an array evaluate the ``list-filter-expr`` against the
element.  If the expression evalutes to ``true``, the item (in its entirety) is
added to the result list.  Otherwise it is excluded from the result list.  A
filter expression is only defined for a JSON array.  Attempting to evaluate a
filter expression against any other type will return ``null``.

Comparison Operators
--------------------

The following operations are supported:

* ``==``, tests for equality.
* ``!=``, tests for inequality.
* ``<``, less than.
* ``<=``, less than or equal to.
* ``>``, greater than.
* ``>=``, greater than or equal to.

The behavior of each operation is dependent on the type of each evaluated
expression.

The comparison semantics for each operator are defined below based on
the corresponding JSON type:

Equality Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For ``string/number/true/false/null`` types, equality is an exact match. A
``string`` is equal to another ``string`` if they they have the exact sequence
of code points.  The literal values ``true/false/null`` are only equal to their
own literal values.  Two JSON objects are equal if they have the same set of
keys and values (given two JSON objeccts ``x`` and ``y``, for each key value
pair ``(i, j)`` in ``x``, there exists an equivalent pair ``(i, j)`` in ``y``).
Two JSON arrays are equal if they have equal elements in the same order (given
two arrays ``x`` and ``y``, for each ``i`` from ``0`` until ``length(x)``,
``x[i] == y[i]``).

Ordering Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ordering operators ``>, >=, <, <=`` are **only** valid for numbers.
Evaluating any other type with a comparison operator will yield a ``null``
value, which will result in the element being excluded from the result list.
For example, given::

    search('foo[?a<b]', {"foo": [{"a": "char", "b": "char"},
                                 {"a": 2, "b": 1},
                                 {"a": 1, "b": 2}]})

The three elements in the foo list are evaluated against ``a < b``.  The first
element resolves to the comparison ``"char" < "bar"``, and because these types
are string, the expression results in ``null``, so the first element is not
included in the result list.  The second element resolves to ``2 < 1``,
which is ``false``, so the second element is excluded from the result list.
The third expression resolves to ``1 < 2`` which evalutes to ``true``, so the
third element is included in the list.  The final result of that expression
is ``[{"a": 1, "b": 2}]``.


Examples
--------

::

  search(foo[?bar==`10`], {"foo": [{"bar": 1}, {"bar": 10}]}) -> [{"bar": 10}]
  search([?bar==`10`], [{"bar": 1}, {"bar": 10}]}) -> [{"bar": 10}]
  search(foo[?a==b], {"foo": [{"a": 1, "b": 2}, {"a": 2, "b": 2}]}) -> [{"a": 2, "b": 2}]


.. _RFC4234: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4234


Functions Expressions
=====================

::

  function-expression = identifier "(" *(function-arg *("," function-arg ) ) ")"
  function-arg        = expression / current-node / expression-type
  current-node        = "@"
  expression-type     = "&" expression


Functions allow users to easily transform and filter data in JMESPath
expressions.

Data Types
----------

In order to support functions, a type system is needed.  The JSON types are used:

* number (integers and double-precision floating-point format in JSON)
* string
* boolean (``true`` or ``false``)
* array (an ordered, sequence of values)
* object (an unordered collection of key value pairs)
* null

There is also an additional type that is not a JSON type that's used in
JMESPath functions:

* expression (denoted by ``&expression``)

current-node
------------

The ``current-node`` token can be used to represent the current node being
evaluated. The ``current-node`` token is useful for functions that require the
current node being evaluated as an argument. For example, the following
expression creates an array containing the total number of elements in the
``foo`` object followed by the value of ``foo["bar"]``.

::

    foo[].[count(@), bar]

JMESPath assumes that all function arguments operate on the current node unless
the argument is a ``literal`` or ``number`` token.  Because of this, an
expression such as ``@.bar`` would be equivalent to just ``bar``, so the
current node is only allowed as a bare expression.


current-node state
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At the start of an expression, the value of the current node is the data
being evaluated by the JMESPath expression. As an expression is evaluated, the
value the the current node represents MUST change to reflect the node currently
being evaluated. When in a projection, the current node value must be changed
to the node currently being evaluated by the projection.

Function Evaluation
-------------------

Functions are evaluated in applicative order.  Each argument must be an
expression, each argument expression must be evaluated before evaluating the
function.  The function is then called with the evaluated function arguments.
The result of the ``function-expression`` is the result returned by the
function call.  If a ``function-expression`` is evaluated for a function that
does not exist, the JMESPath implementation must indicate to the caller that an
``unknown-function`` error occurred.  How and when this error is raised is
implementation specific, but implementations should indicate to the caller that
this specific error occurred.

Functions can either have a specific arity or be variadic with a minimum
number of arguments.  If a ``function-expression`` is encountered where the
arity does not match or the minimum number of arguments for a variadic function
is not provided, then implementations must indicate to the caller than an
``invalid-arity`` error occurred.  How and when this error is raised is
implementation specific.

Each function signature declares the types of its input parameters.  If any
type constraints are not met, implementations must indicate that an
``invalid-type`` error occurred.

In order to accommodate type contraints, functions are provided to convert
types to other types (``to_string``, ``to_number``) which are defined below.
No explicit type conversion happens unless a user specifically uses one of
these type conversion functions.

Function expressions are also allowed as the child element of a sub expression.
This allows functions to be used with projections, which can enable functions
to be applied to every element in a projection.  For example, given the input
data of ``["1", "2", "3", "notanumber", true]``, the following expression can
be used to convert (and filter) all elements to numbers::

    search([].to_number(@), ``["1", "2", "3", "notanumber", true]``) -> [1, 2, 3]

This provides a simple mechanism to explicitly convert types when needed.

Built-in Functions
==================

JMESPath has various built-in functions that operate on different
data types, documented below.  Each function below has a signature
that defines the expected types of the input and the type of the returned
output::

    return_type function_name(type $argname)
    return_type function_name2(type1|type2 $argname)

If a function can accept multiple types for an input value, then the
multiple types are separated with ``|``.  If the resolved arguments do not
match the types specified in the signature, an ``invalid-type`` error occurs.

The ``array`` type can further specify requirements on the type of the elements
if they want to enforce homogeneous types.  The subtype is surrounded by
``[type]``, for example, the function signature below requires its input
argument resolves to an array of numbers::

    return_type foo(array[number] $argname)

As a shorthand, the type ``any`` is used to indicate that the argument can be
of any type (``array|object|number|string|boolean|null``).

Similarly how arrays can specify a type within a list using the
``array[type]`` syntax, expressions can specify their resolved type using
``expression->type`` syntax.  This means that the resolved type of the function
argument must be an expression that itself will resolve to ``type``.

The first function below, ``abs`` is discussed in detail to demonstrate the
above points.  Subsequent function definitions will not include these details
for brevity, but the same rules apply.

.. note::

    All string related functions are defined on the basis of Unicode code
    points; they do not take normalization into account.


abs
---

::

    number abs(number $value)

Returns the absolute value of the provided argument.  The signature indicates
that a number is returned, and that the input argument ``$value`` **must**
resolve to a number, otherwise a ``invalid-type`` error is triggered.

Below is a worked example.  Given::

    {"foo": -1, "bar": "2"}

Evaluating ``abs(foo)`` works as follows:

1. Evaluate the input argument against the current data::

     search(foo, {"foo": -1, "bar": 2"}) -> -1

2. Validate the type of the resolved argument.  In this case
   ``-1`` is of type ``number`` so it passes the type check.

3. Call the function with the resolved argument::

     abs(-1) -> 1

4. The value of ``1`` is the resolved value of the function expression
   ``abs(foo)``.


Below is the same steps for evaluating ``abs(bar)``:

1. Evaluate the input argument against the current data::

     search(bar, {"foo": -1, "bar": 2"}) -> "2"

2. Validate the type of the resolved argument.  In this case
   ``"2"`` is of type ``string`` so we immediately indicate that
   an ``invalid-type`` error occurred.


As a final example, here is the steps for evaluating ``abs(to_number(bar))``:

1. Evaluate the input argument against the current data::

    search(to_number(bar), {"foo": -1, "bar": "2"})

2. In order to evaluate the above expression, we need to evaluate
   ``to_number(bar)``::

    search(bar, {"foo": -1, "bar": "2"}) -> "2"
    # Validate "2" passes the type check for to_number, which it does.
    to_number("2") -> 2

   Note that `to_number`_ is defined below.

3. Now we can evaluate the original expression::

    search(to_number(bar), {"foo": -1, "bar": "2"}) -> 2

4. Call the function with the final resolved value::

    abs(2) -> 2

5. The value of ``2`` is the resolved value of the function expression
   ``abs(to_number(bar))``.
