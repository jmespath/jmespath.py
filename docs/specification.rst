JMESPath Specification
======================

This document describes the specification for jmespath.
In the specification, examples are shown through the use
of a ``search`` function.  The syntax for this function is::

    search(<jmespath expr>, <JSON document>) -> <return value>

For simplicity, the jmespath expression and the JSON document are
not quoted.  For example::

    search(foo, {"foo": "bar"}) -> "bar"

In this specification, ``null`` is used as a return value whenever an
expression does not match.  ``null`` is the generic term that maps to the JSON
``null`` value.  Implementations can replace the ``null`` value with the
language equivalent value.


Grammar
=======

The grammar is specified using ABNF, as described in `RFC4234`_

::

    expression        = sub-expression / index-expression / or-expression / identifier / "*"
    expression        =/ multi-select-list / multi-select-hash
    sub-expression    = expression "." expression
    or-expression     = expression "||" expression
    index-expression  = expression bracket-specifier / bracket-specifier
    multi-select-list = "[" ( non-branched-expr *( "," non-branched-expr ) "]"
    multi-select-hash = "{" ( keyval-expr *( "," keyval-expr ) "}"
    keyval-expr       = identifier ":" non-branched-expr
    non-branched-expr = identifier /
                        non-branched-expr "." identifier /
                        non-branched-expr "[" number "]"
    bracket-specifier = "[" (number / "*") "]"
    number            = [-]1*digit
    digit             = "1" / "2" / "3" / "4" / "5" / "6" / "7" / "8" / "9" / "0"
    identifier        = 1*char
    identifier        =/ quote 1*(unescaped-char / escaped-quote) quote
    escaped-quote     = escape quote
    unescaped-char    = %x30-10FFFF
    escape            = %x5C   ; Back slash: \
    quote             = %x22   ; Double quote: '"'
    char              = %x30-39 / ; 0-9
                        %x41-5A / ; A-Z
                        %x5F /    ; _
                        %x61-7A / ; a-z
                        %x7F-10FFFF


Identifiers
===========


::

    identifier        = 1*char
    identifier        =/ quote 1*(unescaped-char / escaped-quote) quote
    escaped-quote     = escape quote
    unescaped-char    = %x30-10FFFF
    escape            = %x5C   ; Back slash: \
    quote             = %x22   ; Double quote: '"'
    char              = %x30-39 / ; 0-9
                        %x41-5A / ; A-Z
                        %x5F /    ; _
                        %x61-7A / ; a-z
                        %x7F-10FFFF

An ``identifier`` is the most basic expression and can be used to extract a single
element from a JSON document.  The return value for an ``identifier`` is the
value associated with the identifier.  If the ``identifier`` does not exist in
the JSON document, than a ``null`` value is returned.

From the grammar rule listed above identifiers can be one of more characters,
including numbers.  A number is used to extract the value associated with the
numeric identifier.  It is **not** used to access a list element.  The
``index-expression`` is used to access list elements.

An identifier can also be quoted.  This is necessary when an identifier has
characters not specified in the ``char`` grammar rule.  In this situation, an
identifier is specified with a double quote, followed by a number of
characters, followed by a double quote.

Examples
--------

::

   search(foo, {"foo": "value"}) -> "value"
   search(bar, {"foo": "value"}) -> null
   search(foo, {"foo": [0, 1, 2]}) -> [0, 1, 2]
   search("with space", {"with space": "value"}) -> "value"
   search("special chars: !@#", {"special chars: !@#": "value"}) -> "value"
   search("quote\"char", {"quote\"char": "value"}) -> "value"


SubExpressions
==============

::

  sub-expression    = expression "." expression

A subexpression is a combination of two expressions separated by the '.' char.
A subexpression is evaluted as follows:

* Evaluate the expression on the left with the original JSON document.
* Evaluate the expression on the right with the result of the left expression
  evaluation.

In pseudocode::

  left-evaluation = search(left-expression, original-json-document)
  result = search(right-expression, left-evaluation)


A subexpression is itself an expression, so there can be multiple levels of
subexpressions: ``grandparent.parent.child``.


Examples
--------

Given a JSON document: ``{"foo": {"bar": "baz"}}``, and a jmespath expression:
``foo.bar``, the evaluation process would be::

  left-evaluation = search("foo", {"foo": {"bar": "baz"}}) -> {"bar": "baz"}
  result = search("bar": {"bar": "baz"}) -> "baz"

The final result in this example is ``"baz"``.

Additional examples::

   search(foo.bar, {"foo": {"bar": "value"}}) -> "value"
   search(foo.bar, {"foo": {"baz": "value"}}) -> null
   search(foo.bar.baz, {"foo": {"bar": {"baz": "value"}}}) -> "value"


Index Expressions
=================

::

  index-expression  = expression bracket-specifier / bracket-specifier
  bracket-specifier = "[" (number / "*") "]"

An index expression is used to access elements in a list.  Indexing is 0 based,
the index of 0 refers to the first element of the list.  A negative number is a
valid index.  A negative number indicates that indexing is relative to the end
of the list, specifically::

  negative-index == (length of array) + negative-index

Given an array of length ``N``, an index of ``-1`` would be equal to a positive
index of ``N - 1``, which is the last element of the list.  If an index
expression refers to an index that is greater than the length of the array, a
value of ``null`` is returned.

For the grammar rule ``expression bracket-specifier`` the ``expression`` is
first evaluated, and then return value from the ``expression`` is given as
input to the ``bracket-specifier``.

Using a "*" character within a ``bracket-specifier`` is discussed below in the
``wildcard expressions`` section.

Examples
--------

::

  search([0], ["first", "second", "third"]) -> "first"
  search([-1], ["first", "second", "third"]) -> "third"
  search([100], ["first", "second", "third"]) -> null
  search(foo[0], {"foo": ["first", "second", "third"]) -> "first"
  search(foo[100], {"foo": ["first", "second", "third"]) -> null
  search(foo[0][0], {"foo": [[0, 1], [1, 2]]}) -> 0


Or Expressions
==============

::

  or-expression     = expression "||" expression

An or expression will evaluate to either the left expression or the right
expression.  If the evaluation of the left expression is not null it is used as
the return value.  If the evaluation of the right expression is not null it is
used as the return value.  If neither the left or right expression are
non-null, then a value of null is returned.

Examples
--------

::

  search(foo || bar, {"foo": "foo-value"}) -> "foo-value"
  search(foo || bar, {"bar": "bar-value"}) -> "bar-value"
  search(foo || bar, {"foo": "foo-value", "bar": "bar-value"}) -> "foo-value"
  search(foo || bar, {"baz": "baz-value"}) -> null
  search(foo || bar || baz, {"baz": "baz-value"}) -> "baz-value"
  search(override || mylist[-1], {"mylist": ["one", "two"]}) -> "two"
  search(override || mylist[-1], {"mylist": ["one", "two"], "override": "yes"}) -> "yes"


MultiSelect List
================

::

    multi-select-list = "[" ( non-branched-expr *( "," non-branched-expr ) "]"
    non-branched-expr = identifier /
                        non-branched-expr "." identifier /
                        non-branched-expr "[" number "]"

A multiselect expression is used to extract a subset of elements from a JSON
hash.  There are two version of multiselect, one in which the multiselect
expression is enclosed in ``{...}`` and one which is enclosed in ``[...]``.
This section describes the ``[...]`` version.
Within the start and closing characters is one or more non
branched expressions separated by a comma.  Each non branched expression will
be evaluated against the JSON document.  Each returned element will be the
result of evaluating the non branched expression. A ``multi-select-list`` with
``N`` non branched expressions will result in a list of length ``N``.  Given a
multiselect expression ``[expr-1,expr-2,...,expr-n]``, the evaluated expression
will return ``[evaluate(expr-1), evaluate(expr-2), ..., evaluate(expr-n)]``.

Examples
--------

::

  search([foo,bar], {"foo": "a", "bar": "b", "baz": "c"}) -> ["a", "b"]
  search([foo,bar[0]], {"foo": "a", "bar": ["b"], "baz": "c"}) -> ["a", "b"]
  search([foo,bar.baz], {"foo": "a", "bar": {"baz": "b"}}) -> ["a", "b"]
  search([foo,baz], {"foo": "a", "bar": "b"}) -> ["a", null]


MultiSelect Hash
================

::

    multi-select-hash = "{" ( keyval-expr *( "," keyval-expr ) "}"
    keyval-expr       = identifier ":" non-branched-expr
    non-branched-expr = identifier /
                        non-branched-expr "." identifier /
                        non-branched-expr "[" number "]"

A ``multi-select-hash`` expression is similar to a ``multi-select-list``
expression, except that a hash is created instead of a list.  A
``multi-select-hash`` expression also requires key names to be provided, as
specified in the ``keyval-expr`` rule.  Given the following rule::

    keyval-expr       = identifier ":" non-branched-expr

The ``identifier`` is used as the key name and the result of evaluating the
``non-branched-expr`` is the value associated with the ``identifier`` key.

Each ``keyval-expr`` within the ``multi-select-hash`` will correspond to a
single key value pair in the created hash.


Examples
--------

Given a ``multi-select-hash`` expression ``{foo: one.two, bar: bar}`` and the
data ``{"bar": "bar", {"one": {"two": "one-two"}}}``, the expression is
evaluated as follows:

1. A hash is created: ``{}``
2. A key ``foo`` is created whose value is the result of evaluating ``one.two``
   against the provided JSON document: ``{"foo": evaluate(one.two, <data>)}``
3. A key ``bar`` is created whose value is the result of evaluting the
   expression ``bar`` against the provided JSON document.

The final result will be: ``{"foo": "one-two", "bar": "bar"}``.

Additional examples:

::

  search({foo: foo, bar: bar}, {"foo": "a", "bar": "b", "baz": "c"})
                -> {"foo": "a", "bar": "b"}
  search({foo: foo, firstbar: bar[0]}, {"foo": "a", "bar": ["b"]})
                -> {"foo": "a", "firstbar": "b"}
  search({foo: foo, "bar.baz": bar.baz}, {"foo": "a", "bar": {"baz": "b"}})
                -> {"foo": "a", "bar.baz": "b"}
  search({foo: foo, baz: baz}, {"foo": "a", "bar": "b"})
                -> {"foo": "a", "bar": null}


Wildcard Expressions
====================

::

    expression        =/ "*"
    bracket-specifier = "[" "*" "]"

A wildcard expression is a expression of either ``*`` or ``[*]``.  A wildcard
expression can return multiple elements, and the remaining expressions are
evaluated against each returned element from a wildcard expression.  The
``[*]`` syntax applies to a list type and the ``*`` syntax applies to a hash
type.

The ``[*]`` syntax will return all the elements in a list.  Any subsequent
expressions will be evaluated against each individual element.  Given an
expression ``[*].child-expr``, and a list of N elements, the evaluation of
this expression would be ``[child-expr(el-0), child-expr(el-2), ...,
child-expr(el-N)]``.

The ``*`` syntax will return a list of the hash element's values.  Any subsequent
expression will be evaluated against each individual element in the list.

Note that if any subsequent expression after a wildcard expression returns a
``null`` value, it is omitted from the final result list.

Examples
--------

::

  search([*].foo, [{"foo": 1}, {"foo": 2}, {"foo": 3}]) -> [1, 2, 3]
  search([*].foo, [{"foo": 1}, {"foo": 2}, {"bar": 3}]) -> [1, 2]
  search('*.foo', {"a": {"foo": 1}, "b": {"foo": 2}, "c": {"bar": 1}}) -> [1, 2]
